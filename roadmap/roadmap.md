<!-- Key Concepts: -->

What is ML (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement)

Data → Features → Labels

Training vs Testing

Overfitting / Underfitting

Bias-Variance tradeoff

Model evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC)

<!-- . Data Preparation (The Hidden Hero of ML) -->

Before you can feed data to a model, you must clean and prepare it.

<!-- Key Concepts: -->

Handling missing data

Encoding categorical variables (LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder)

Feature scaling (Standardization, Normalization)

Train-test split

Feature selection & dimensionality reduction (PCA)
<!-- for algorithms -->

<!-- Regression (predicting numbers): -->

Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

<!-- Classification (predicting categories): -->

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Naive Bayes

<!--  Unsupervised Learning -->

K-Means Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering

PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)
